                    <p>
                        My expertise lies in both frontend and backend web development. On the frontend, I have mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. When it comes to the backend, I am proficient in utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and Passport.js to build robust and scalable server-side applications. I am well-versed in working with MySQL and MongoDB databases, allowing me to efficiently store and retrieve data.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Collaboration is a breeze for me, thanks to my experience with Git and GitHub for seamless teamwork and version control. Currently, I am expanding my skillset by diving into React.js, a powerful frontend library for building dynamic and efficient user interfaces.

                        Additionally, I bring a strong foundation in Java Servlets and JDBC applications, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of both modern and traditional web development approaches. I am passionate about learning and always eager to explore new technologies in the web development space, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills.
